# Retrospection - To Be Better Next Time

This document captures reflections on our development process to identify areas for improvement.

## Milestones & Reflections

*(Entries will be added here at significant milestones or stable points.)*

### Initial Setup & Rule Implementation (2025-04-11)

*   **What went well?**
    *   Successfully implemented the `.windsurfrules` including `APPLES` folder structure (`BANANAS.md`, `ROSES.md`) and `SYSTEMPROMPT` folder.
    *   Retroactively populated `BANANAS.md` and `ROSES.md` based on previous interactions.
    *   Refined the tracking format (hashing, linked hashes, emoji counts) for better clarity and security.
*   **What caused friction?**
    *   Initial setup instructions (`.windsurfrules`) were provided later in the process, requiring retroactive creation and population of tracking files.
    *   Minor issues like duplicate columns and accidentally removing text during edits required correction.
*   **How could we improve?**
    *   Establish project structure and rules (`.windsurfrules`) at the very beginning of a new project or major feature work.
    *   Double-check edits, especially complex table formats, before finalizing.
