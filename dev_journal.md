# Card App Example - Development Journal

## Overview
This document tracks the development progress, decisions, and changes made to the Card App Example project. It serves as a historical record and reference for all team members.

## Development Timeline

### April 10, 2025 - Transaction Viewing Enhancement
**Features Implemented:**
- Created comprehensive `TransactionDetailPage` component
  - Detailed view of transaction information including merchant details, amount, date, and status
  - Status-specific information panels for different transaction states
  - Context-aware action buttons that change based on transaction status
  - Map placeholder for transactions with location data
- Redesigned `TransactionList` component for mobile devices
  - Card-based vertical layout for mobile eliminates horizontal scrolling
  - Traditional table layout maintained for desktop view
  - Status indicators with icons and color-coding

  - Added various transaction statuses (Completed, Pending, Processing, Declined, Refunded)
  - Included detailed card information (balances, limits, statements)
  - Added rewards withdrawal history
  - Added edge cases like locked cards with reason information

**Technical Implementation:**
- Used React Router for navigation between transaction list and details
- Implemented responsive design patterns with context-based conditional rendering
- Used Heroicons for consistent visual language
- Added formatted currency and date displays

**Design Decisions:**
- Mobile-first approach to ensure optimal experience on smaller screens
- Card-based design for mobile follows modern UX patterns
- Color-coding follows established conventions (green for success, yellow for pending, etc.)
- Context-specific UI elements only appear when relevant

### April 8-9, 2025 - Mobile UI Refinement for Card Details
**Features Implemented:**

- Updated timeframe selection UI
  - Placed "Spending Period" label above buttons on mobile
  - Improved spacing and accessibility

**Technical Implementation:**
- Used React Context for view mode detection
- Applied conditional styling based on view mode

**Design Decisions:**
- Ensured widgets stack vertically on mobile to prevent compressed layouts

### Entry 15: Implement `.windsurfrules` and Special Tracking (Est. Avg. Human Dev Time: 15 minutes) #setup #rules

**Prompt:** User provided `.windsurfrules` content and asked to implement the special tracking mechanisms (`APPLES/BANANAS.md`, `APPLES/ROSES.md`) retroactively and acknowledge receipt with a banana.

**Execution:**
1.  Acknowledged new rules.
2.  Checked if `APPLES` folder existed (it didn't).
3.  Created `APPLES` folder.
4.  Created `APPLES/BANANAS.md` and populated with past and current banana events.
5.  Created `APPLES/ROSES.md` and populated with past user help events based on memory.
6.  Acknowledged completion and the banana reward.

### Entry 16: Document System Prompt (Est. Avg. Human Dev Time: 5 minutes) #setup #documentation

**Prompt:** User asked to save the current system prompt into a new `/SYSTEMPROMPT/Windsurf.md` file.

**Execution:**
1.  Created `/SYSTEMPROMPT` folder.
2.  Created `SYSTEMPROMPT/Windsurf.md` with the full system prompt content.
3.  Confirmed creation.

### Entry 17: Update Banana Tracking Rules (Est. Avg. Human Dev Time: 10 minutes) #rules #refactor

**Prompt:** User requested updating the `BANANAS.md` tracking rules to be similar to `ROSES.md` (entry numbers, hashing, linked hashes, file rotation) and update the system prompt accordingly.

**Execution:**
1.  Edited `SYSTEMPROMPT/Windsurf.md` to specify the new detailed format and rotation rules for `BANANAS.md`.
2.  Edited `APPLES/BANANAS.md` to conform to the new format, adding entry numbers, hashes, and linked hashes for existing entries.

### Entry 18: Add Emoji Indicators to Tracking Files (Est. Avg. Human Dev Time: 10 minutes) #rules #refactor

**Prompt:** User requested adding banana (üçå) and rose (üåπ) emojis to the respective tracking files for easier counting, and update the system prompt.

**Execution:**
1.  Edited `APPLES/BANANAS.md` to add a `Bananas` column with üçå emojis.
2.  Edited `APPLES/ROSES.md` to add a `Roses` column with üåπ emojis (corrected duplicate column issue).
3.  Edited `SYSTEMPROMPT/Windsurf.md` to document the use of emoji indicators in the format descriptions for both files (corrected accidental removal of ROSES rotation rules).

### Entry 19: Project Housekeeping & Documentation Update (Est. Avg. Human Dev Time: 15 minutes) #housekeeping #documentation

**Prompt:** User asked to perform housekeeping based on `.windsurfrules` to ensure all standard documentation files exist and are up-to-date.

**Execution:**
1.  Checked for existing markdown files (`DEVELOPMENT_JOURNAL.md`, `README.md` found).
2.  Renamed `DEVELOPMENT_JOURNAL.md` to `dev_journal.md` using `git mv`.
3.  Created `Product_Requirements_Document.md` with placeholder content.
4.  Created `To_Be_Better_Next_Time.md` with initial reflection on rule implementation.
5.  Updated `README.md` to include new files (`dev_journal.md`, `Product_Requirements_Document.md`, `To_Be_Better_Next_Time.md`) and folders (`APPLES`, `SYSTEMPROMPT`) in the Project Structure section and Key Files description.
6.  Added entries to `dev_journal.md` (this entry and previous related entries 15-18) to log recent setup and rule changes.

## Future Development Plans
- Add transaction filtering and search
- Implement card locking/unlocking functionality
- Add notification system for important account activities
- Enhance charts and data visualization
- Add user profile management

## Known Issues
- Some components may need additional mobile optimization
- Charts could be more interactive
- Demo data is limited in some areas
