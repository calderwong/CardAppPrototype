## **Product Requirements Document: Credit and Debit Card Management App**

### Version: 1.0  
### Date: April 10, 2025

## **1. Introduction**

This document outlines the product requirements for a new Credit and Debit Card Management App. The primary goal is to provide users with a centralized, secure, and intuitive platform to manage their various credit and debit cards effectively. This includes monitoring spending, enhancing security through features like card locking and alerts, managing financial obligations (especially for credit cards), and gaining deeper insights into spending habits through categorization and analysis. The app could potentially be developed as a standalone application (potentially with offline capabilities) or as a module integrated within an existing banking application. This PRD focuses specifically on the front-end components, user interactions, and the data flow (data in/out) between the front end and a hypothetical backend API, deliberately ignoring the complexities of backend logic and database design.

## **2. Goals**

*   **Unified Management:** Provide a single interface for users to view and manage multiple credit and debit cards.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Empower users with tools to control card security, such as instant card locking/unlocking, customizable transaction alerts, and secure authentication.
*   **Spending Insight:** Offer robust tools for tracking transactions, automatically categorizing spending, visualizing spending patterns, and setting/monitoring budgets.
*   **Financial Control:** Help users manage credit card payments by providing clear due date information, payment reminders, and potentially integrated bill pay options.
*   **User Experience:** Deliver a simple, intuitive, reliable, and visually appealing user experience that makes card management effortless.
*   **Flexibility:** Design with considerations for both standalone (potentially offline-first) and bank-integrated deployment models.

Compliance with relevant standards (e.g., PCI DSS if handling raw card data directly, though typically backend handles this). Robust authentication and session management. Protection against common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, etc.).
*   **Performance:** Fast app startup time. Smooth scrolling through long transaction lists. Quick response times for actions like card locking (< 1-2 seconds). Efficient data loading and caching. Optimized API calls.
*   **Reliability:** High availability (minimal downtime). Accurate data display (balances, transactions). Reliable delivery of critical alerts and notifications. Graceful handling of network errors or API failures. Robust data validation.
*   **Usability:** Intuitive navigation and information architecture. Clean, uncluttered UI design consistent with platform guidelines (iOS/Android). Clear feedback for user actions. Accessibility support (screen reader compatibility, dynamic font sizes, sufficient color contrast). Responsive Design & View Toggle: The prototype must be designed responsively to adapt to various screen sizes, primarily targeting standard web/desktop and mobile portrait views. A mechanism (e.g., a clearly visible toggle button or developer tool integration) should be included in the prototype to easily switch between a simulated mobile view (constrained width) and a full-screen web view during demonstrations.
*   **Scalability:** (Primarily BE) APIs should be designed to handle increasing numbers of users, cards, and transactions without performance degradation.
*   **Privacy:** Clear privacy policy. Minimize collection of unnecessary user data. If using third-party SDKs, review their data practices. Secure handling of permissions (e.g., camera, notifications, SMS).

## **6. Future Considerations / Emerging Trends**

*   **AI-Driven Insights:** Proactive financial advice, anomaly detection in spending, personalized budget recommendations.
*   **Open Banking:** Aggregate data from other financial institutions for a complete financial picture.
*   **Gamification:** Introduce points, challenges, or rewards for positive financial behaviors (e.g., meeting budget goals).
*   **Subscription Management:** Automatically identify recurring payments and provide tools to manage/cancel them.
*   **Enhanced Biometrics:** Explore behavioral biometrics or more advanced device authentication methods.
*   **Contextual Features:** Offer relevant actions or information based on user context (e.g., location-based offers, travel mode).

## **7. Open Issues**

*   Final decision on Standalone vs. Integrated deployment model.
*   Specific choice of charting library for visualizations.
*   Detailed specification for offline data storage and backup/sync mechanism (if pursued).
*   Prioritization of optional features for Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
*   Strategy for handling different bank API capabilities if integrating.
