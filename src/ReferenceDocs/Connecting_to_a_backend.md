# Connecting to a Backend

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive guide for developers looking to connect the Card Management App frontend to a backend service. While the prototype currently operates with mock data, a production version would require robust backend integration to handle sensitive financial information, authentication, and real-time transaction processing.

The following sections outline each feature that requires backend communication, including:
- Authentication and user management
- Card data retrieval and management
- Transaction processing and history
- Budget tracking and analytics
- Rewards systems
- Security features
- Payment management

For each feature, we provide:
1. **Feature description**: What the feature does and why backend integration is needed
2. **API endpoint examples**: Sample RESTful API endpoints that would support the feature
3. **Request/response examples**: JSON schema examples for the requests and responses
4. **Implementation considerations**: Security, performance, and architectural considerations
5. **Testing recommendations**: Suggestions for mocking and testing the integration

This guide is meant to serve as a blueprint for backend developers to understand the frontend requirements and for frontend developers to implement the necessary API integrations. The examples provided are recommendations and can be adapted to fit your specific backend architecture, whether you're using RESTful APIs, GraphQL, or other integration patterns.

{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "usr_12345",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "first_name": "Alice",
      "last_name": "Wonderland",
      "phone_number": "+1234567890",
      "requires_2fa": true
    },
    "tokens": {
      "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
      "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
      "expires_in": 3600
    }
  }
}
```

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Rewards Calculation**:
   - Implement accurate rewards calculation based on card type and transaction categories
   - Handle promotional reward rates and special categories
   - Support multiple reward types (points, cash back, miles)
   - Consider batch processing for rewards calculation

2. **Rewards Redemption**:
   - Implement secure redemption flows with proper validation
   - Support multiple redemption methods (statement credit, bank deposit, gift cards)
   - Handle partial redemptions and minimum redemption amounts
   - Provide clear confirmation and tracking of redemption status

3. **Offers Management**:
   - Develop targeting algorithm for personalized offers
   - Implement offer activation and tracking
   - Support limited-time and location-based offers
   - Handle offer eligibility rules based on card type and user history

4. **Integration Points**:
   - Connect with transaction processing to trigger rewards
   - Integrate with banking systems for reward deposits
   - Establish merchant partnerships for special offers
   - Link with notification system for rewards alerts

### Testing Recommendations

1. Verify rewards calculation accuracy across different transaction types
2. Test redemption workflows including validation and error handling
3. Validate offer activation and qualification logic
4. Test rewards expiration handling and notifications
5. Simulate high-volume transaction scenarios to test rewards calculation performance

## Conclusion

This document outlines the comprehensive backend integration needs for the Card Management App. By following this guide, developers can implement a robust, secure, and feature-rich backend that supports all the functionality showcased in the frontend prototype.

### Key Integration Considerations

1. **Security First**: Given the financial nature of the application, all backend services must prioritize security at every level. This includes secure API design, proper authentication and authorization, encryption of sensitive data, and ongoing security monitoring.

2. **Scalable Architecture**: Design backend services to scale with user growth. Consider microservice architectures where appropriate to allow independent scaling of high-demand features like transaction processing.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize API responses for mobile bandwidth and minimize payload sizes. Consider strategies like pagination, partial responses, and efficient caching.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with meaningful error codes and messages. Log errors appropriately for debugging while being mindful of sensitive information.

5. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date API documentation using standards like OpenAPI (Swagger) to facilitate frontend-backend collaboration.

6. **Testing Strategy**: Develop a robust testing strategy including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Create a separate testing environment with mock data.

7. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure the backend complies with financial regulations relevant to your jurisdiction, such as PCI-DSS for payment handling, GDPR or CCPA for user data, and financial reporting requirements.

### Implementation Approach

We recommend a phased approach to backend implementation:

1. **Phase 1: Core Authentication and Card Management**
   - Implement user authentication and session management
   - Build basic card information retrieval endpoints
   - Create simple transaction listing functionality

2. **Phase 2: Transactions and Payments**
   - Implement detailed transaction viewing and filtering
   - Add payment processing capabilities
   - Build dispute management workflows

3. **Phase 3: Analytics and Budgeting**
   - Develop budget configuration and tracking
   - Implement spending analysis features
   - Create insights and recommendations engine

4. **Phase 4: Rewards and Advanced Features**
   - Build rewards tracking and redemption
   - Implement offers and promotions
   - Add advanced security features and alerts

By following this implementation plan, you can progressively enhance the application while always maintaining a functional product. This approach also allows for user feedback to inform later development phases.

The Card Management App has significant potential to provide users with a comprehensive tool for managing their financial life. A well-designed backend will be the foundation that makes this possible.
