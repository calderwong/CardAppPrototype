## **Design Brief: Credit & Debit Card Management App**

### Version: 1.0  
### Date: April 10, 2025  
### Project: Credit and Debit Card Management Mobile Application

## 1. Background & Overview

Based on the detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD: prd\_card\_management\_app\_v2), we are designing a mobile application to help users effectively manage their credit and debit cards. The app aims to provide a unified platform for viewing card details, tracking spending, enhancing security, managing budgets, and handling payments/reminders. The app needs to support both credit and debit cards, catering to the specific needs associated with each (e.g., payment due dates for credit cards, linked account balance for debit cards). The design should consider flexibility for potential deployment as a standalone app or integration within an existing banking environment.

## 2. Project Objectives

* Design an intuitive and seamless user interface that makes managing multiple cards effortless.
* Create a visually appealing and trustworthy aesthetic that instills user confidence, drawing inspiration from the clean, member-focused design of BECU.org.
* Ensure key features like card locking, transaction viewing, spending analysis, and alert configuration are easily accessible and understandable.
* Visually differentiate between credit and debit card information where necessary (e.g., displaying credit limits vs. linked balances).
* Optimize the user experience for mobile platforms (iOS and Android), ensuring responsiveness and adherence to platform conventions where appropriate.
* Design clear data visualizations for spending analysis and budget tracking.

## 3. Target Audience

The design should cater to the personas identified in the PRD:

* **The Organizer:** Needs clarity, easy navigation, and consolidated views.
* **The Budget Master:** Requires clear data presentation, intuitive charts, and easy-to-use budgeting tools.
* **The Security Sentinel:** Needs prominent security controls, clear status indicators, and trustworthy visual cues.
* **The Rewards Hunter:** Needs rewards information to be easily visible and accessible.
* **The Convenience Craver:** Appreciates streamlined flows, minimal friction, and integration with platform features (camera, digital wallets).

## 4. Design Principles

* **Clarity First:** Information should be presented clearly and concisely. Avoid jargon. Ensure key data points (balances, due dates) are immediately visible.
* **Simplicity:** Strive for an uncluttered interface and intuitive navigation. Reduce cognitive load wherever possible.
* **Security & Trust:** The design must feel secure and reliable. Use visual cues that reinforce trust and safety.
* **Empowerment:** Give users easy control over their cards and finances (locking, alerts, budgets).
* **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent visual language and interaction patterns throughout the app.
* **Accessibility:** Design for inclusivity, adhering to accessibility guidelines (WCAG AA as a minimum target).

## 5. Visual Style & Tone (Inspired by BECU.org)

* **Overall Tone:** Trustworthy, friendly, helpful, secure, modern, member-focused, straightforward.
* **Color Palette:**
    * **Primary:** Utilize blues similar to BECU's branding for core navigation, buttons, and trust-building elements.
    * **Secondary:** Incorporate greens (also seen in BECU branding) for positive reinforcement, success states, or potentially financial growth indicators (like budget progress).
    * **Accents:** Use a limited, brighter accent color (e.g., an orange or yellow, similar to accents sometimes used by BECU) for key calls-to-action or highlighting important information/alerts, but use sparingly.
    * **Neutrals:** Employ ample white space and light grays for backgrounds and separation, creating a clean and airy feel. Dark grays/blacks for text.
* **Typography:**
    * Use a clean, highly readable sans-serif font family (similar to those used on BECU.org, e.g., Open Sans, Lato, or a comparable modern sans-serif).
    * Establish a clear typographic hierarchy using font weights (e.g., Light, Regular, Semibold, Bold) and sizes for headings, subheadings, body text, and captions. Ensure excellent legibility on mobile screens.
* **Iconography:**
    * Use simple, clean, and universally understood line icons. Icons should be consistent in style and weight. Consider custom icons for unique features if necessary, maintaining the overall style.
* **Imagery:** If imagery is used (e.g., for onboarding or empty states), it should align with BECU's approachable style â€“ potentially featuring diverse individuals/community scenes or abstract graphics that convey security and ease. Avoid generic stock photos.
* **Layout & Spacing:** Employ a grid-based layout for structure and consistency. Use generous white space to improve readability and reduce clutter. Utilize card-based UI elements for displaying distinct pieces of information (like individual cards or budget summaries).
* **Component Styling:**
    * **Buttons:** Solid primary color fills for main actions, potentially secondary/outline styles for less critical actions. Use rounded corners (similar to BECU's web components). Ensure clear hover/tap states.
    * **Forms:** Clean and simple input fields with clear labels. Minimal visual clutter.
    * **Charts:** Clean and easy-to-read data visualizations. Use the color palette effectively to differentiate data series. Ensure charts are interactive and responsive.

## 6. Key Screens & Flows

The design must cover (at minimum) the user flows and screens associated with these core features from the PRD:

* Login / Signup / Authentication (including Biometrics/PIN)
* Card Dashboard / Card List View
* Add Card Flow (Manual & Camera Scan)
* Card Details View (Credit & Debit variations)
* Card Locking / Unlocking interaction
* Transaction History View (List & Detail)
* Spending Analysis / Insights View (Charts & Summaries)
* Budget Creation & Tracking View
* Alert Configuration Screen
* Payment Due Information Display & Reminder Flow (Credit Card)
* (If applicable) Bill Pay Flow
* (If applicable) Virtual Card Management
* (If applicable) Travel Notice Flow
* Settings (including security, notifications, profile)

## 7. Mandatories & Constraints

* Design for native mobile platforms (iOS and Android). Consider platform-specific conventions where appropriate but maintain overall brand consistency.
* Ensure designs are responsive and adapt to various screen sizes and orientations.
* Prioritize accessibility standards (WCAG AA).
* The design must accommodate both standalone and potentially integrated scenarios (implying the UI might need to fit within an existing app's shell).

## 8. Deliverables

* High-fidelity mockups for all key screens and states (including empty states, loading states, error states).
* Clickable prototype demonstrating key user flows.
* Style guide detailing colors, typography, iconography, component styles, spacing, etc.
* Asset handoff for development (icons, illustrations, etc.).
